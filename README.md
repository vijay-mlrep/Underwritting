# Underwritting


Our main objective in this project is to build a Machine Learning Model to determine whether we should lend money to a customer, given various budget and/or risk constraints. Most of the profits made by banks are by investing money in people or companies, and gaining profit from interest paid. It is crucial to know the investment risk of each customer before we provide him/her with a loan.

We need to answer few questions before approving a loan

Can the customer repay the loan amount within stipulated time?

Is the customer going to miss any installments?

After analyzing these risks, do we approve him/her for a loan?

As the underwriting team for our bank, it is our goal to detail whether the customer will default or not. This project will help the bank to better understand its customer base from a risk perspective.
